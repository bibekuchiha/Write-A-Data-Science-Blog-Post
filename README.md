There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

Project Motivation
For this project, I was interestested in using StackOverflow Dataset(2017 and 2018) from Kaggle to better understand:

Question 1:Which Country has the highest number of users in Stackoverflow ?

Question 2:Which Programming Language are highly used in United States ?

Question 3:Which Programming Language are in highly demand in United States ?


File Descriptions
There are 1 notebooks available here to showcase work related to the above questions. The notebooks is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title. Markdown cells & comments were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.

Results
The main findings of the code can be found at the post available here.
