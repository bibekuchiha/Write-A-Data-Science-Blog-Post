## Installation <a name="installation"></a>
There ought to be no vital libraries to run the code here past the Anaconda dispersion of Python. The code should run without any issues utilizing Python adaptations 3.*. 

You should download Stackoverflow's 2017 and 2018 Annual Developer Survey and put in explicit envelopes. You can discover the information to download[here](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey). </br>

To move the downloaded records to the particular folder, you can execute.</br>

1. Stackoverflow’s 2017 data </br>
` mv survey_results_public.csv Write-a-Data-Science-Blog-Post/data/2017/survey_results_public.csv `</br>

2. Stackoverflow’s 2018 data </br>
` mv survey_results_public.csv Write-a-Data-Science-Blog-Post/data/2018/survey_results_public.csv `</br>

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>
