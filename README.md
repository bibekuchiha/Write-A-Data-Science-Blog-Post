## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using StackOverflow Dataset(2017 and 2018) from Kaggle to better understand:

Question 1: Which Country has the highest number of users in Stackoverflow ?

Question 2: Which Programming Language are highly used in United States ?
Question 3: Which Programming Language are in highly demand in United States ?
