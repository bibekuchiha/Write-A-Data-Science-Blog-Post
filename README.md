## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.
You will need to download Stackoverflow’s 2017 and 2018 Annual Developer Survey and put in specific folders. You can find the data to download [here](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey). </br>

To move the downloaded files to the specific folder, you can execute. </br>

1. Stackoverflow’s 2017 data </br>
` mv survey_results_public.csv Write-a-Data-Science-Blog-Post/data/2017/survey_results_public.csv `</br>

2. Stackoverflow’s 2018 data </br>
` mv survey_results_public.csv Write-a-Data-Science-Blog-Post/data/2018/survey_results_public.csv `</br>

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using StackOverflow Dataset(2017 and 2018) from Kaggle to better understand:

Question 1: Which Country has the highest number of users in Stackoverflow ?

Question 2: Which Programming Language are highly used in United States ?

Question 3: Which Programming Language are in highly demand in United States ?
